## 52 Week - 52 Stuff
I got literally bored by following the same thing again and again .......... (I am lying)


I got frustrated by procastinating my project and playing minecraft then at night regret :/
Hence I wanted to do something new and creative everyday as well as I wanted to build things fast that I don't because of procastinating, hence started 52 week 52 challenge in which every week I will be making something really cool and new things, that will push me to learn, solve problems..

Some:
 - I may take more than a week to complete a stuff but on that condition I will have to give reason why...
